        <p>Megan graduated from Louisiana State University with a Bachelor of Arts in Art History. She has experience with multiple museum industry roles, serving as a registrar and curator intern with LSU's Museum of Art and then as a tour guide and customer service associate at the Walt Disney Family Museum. These experiences have given her a wide set of practical skills that can transfer to the tech world, including strong organizational skills, the creativity to parse a large story to the specific needs of the different audiences, and problem solving on a day-to-day basis. She is looking forward to combining these skills with her newfound love of coding.</p>
